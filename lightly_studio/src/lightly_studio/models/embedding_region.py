The frontend sends the lasso/rectangle geometry (a handful of vertices, a few KB) instead
of the full list of selected sample ids. The backend reproduces the exact selection by
running point-in-polygon over the cached 2D projection, so the request body stays
constant-size regardless of how many points are selected.
